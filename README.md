Implemented regularized linear regression and regularized support vector regression techniques to create models that can predict ‘waste management cost per capita’ of a given municipality in Cost Prediction corresponds to information about a municipality in a certain country.It also covers critical analysis of the following 
points:
1) Impact of L1, L2, and elastic net regularization on linear regression coefficients, 
performance, and interpretability.
2) Impact of L2 regularization on support vector regression performance and interpretability. 
3) Implement random forest regression, then compare its performance and interpretability with respect to regularized linear regression and regularized support vector regression models.
